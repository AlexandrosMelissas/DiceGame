A 2 player dice luck game made with Vanilla Javascript

1. The player who gathers 100 global points wins.
2. Each player has infinite tries each turn untill he rolls a '0'. If he does then he looses all of his current points and it's the next player's turn
3. If a player decides to "keep" his current points then his current points get added to his global points and it's the next player's turn.
